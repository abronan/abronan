### Hello there 👋

My name is *Alexandre Beslic*, I'm a software engineer specialized in distributed systems. A few things about me:

- 📢 I have contributed to **docker**, **swarmkit**, **libkv/valkeyrie** to name a few
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I got a Master's Degree in Distributed Systems and Software from La Sorbonne University (Paris)
- 👨🏻‍💻 I have worked and contributed to various industries: Developer tooling and Infrastructure, Retail, FinTech...
- 📖 I mostly use **Golang** in a professional context but I also like to tinker with **Rust** on my spare time
- 🎮 I'm a gamer. I play Halo Infinite, Diablo 2 Resurrected and Guild Wars 2
- 💬 You can reach out to talk about distsys, databases, consensus algorithms, CRDTs, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: **@abronan** on twitter/linkedin

My main interests are on infrastructure, container orchestration, cluster management and correctness guarantees in distributed systems.

I'm currently less active in the Open Source community since my work and responsibilities are taking a lot of energy from me 🚴🏻‍♂
